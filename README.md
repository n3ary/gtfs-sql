# gtfs-publisher

A feed-agnostic GTFS publisher. Reads each operator's upstream source via a
per-feed adapter package, and publishes the three artifacts any GTFS
consumer needs:

1. **Raw GTFS Schedule zips** — the spec-compliant `.gtfs.zip` for each feed,
   content-addressed by sha256. This is the artifact external GTFS tooling
   (onebusaway, gtfs-to-html, transit planners, validators) reads. It is
   **strictly the public GTFS Schedule spec** — no per-feed extensions are
   added here.

2. **GTFS-RT feeds** — a Fastify HTTP server proxies live `vehicle_positions`,
   `trip_updates`, and `service_alerts` GTFS-Realtime protobuf feeds. Same
   upstream sources as the static side; the protocol-buffer wire format is
   the standard, no extensions.

3. **SQLite blobs** — `<id>-<hash12>.sqlite3.gz`, one per feed. This is what
   the [n3ary/app](https://github.com/n3ary/app) PWA stores in OPFS and
   queries at runtime. **Per-feed extensions are injected here** — the
   cluj adapter, for example, adds `networks.network_color` and a
   `_neary_config` table — but the extensions **never leak into the
   published `.gtfs.zip`**. The zip stays spec-clean; the sqlite blob
   carries whatever each consumer needs.

> [!NOTE]
> **Live artifacts**: [`https://gtfs.n3ary.com/feeds.json`](https://gtfs.n3ary.com/feeds.json)
> (R2 via custom domain `gtfs.n3ary.com`)

## What this repo is not

- It is **not** a GTFS validator. It consumes whatever the adapter produces.
- It is **not** a feed-source registry. Operators live in `feeds/<id>/config.json`,
  with `source.publisher` pointing at a published adapter package (e.g.
  `@n3ary/gtfs-adapter-<feed>` from
  [`n3ary/gtfs-adapters`](https://github.com/n3ary/gtfs-adapters)).
- It is **not** a trip planner. It only publishes data.

```

## Adding a new feed

1. Add `feeds/<id>/config.json` (copy an existing one as a template).
2. Set `source.type` to `"adapter"` + `source.publisher` to the adapter's
   npm package name.
3. Add the feed's required secrets to `secrets[]` (env var names).
4. Add the env vars to the GitHub Actions secrets on this repo, then add
   them to `.github/workflows/daily.yml`'s env block.
5. Add the Transitous source name (if any) to `countries.json`'s `include[]`
   so the catalog lookup finds it.

No code change in `apps/gtfs-static/src/cli.ts` — the orchestrator is
feed-agnostic and discovers adapters by `source.publisher` at runtime.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run pipeline   # full build → outputs/ + (optionally) R2
npm test           # vitest --run --passWithNoTests
```
