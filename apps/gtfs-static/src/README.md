# packages/gtfs-static/src

The SQLite + registry build published to the Cloudflare R2 bucket at
`gtfs.n3ary.com`. See [../../../README.md](../../../README.md) for what this
repo is and isn't.

## Entry point

```bash
pnpm pipeline            # = node dist/cli.js (after `pnpm build`)
```

## Steps

`cli.ts` walks each feed and runs:

1. **`resolve-feeds.ts`** — read [`../countries.json`](../countries.json)
   `include[]` (single source of truth for what we publish). For each
   entry: fetch the matching source from Transitous's `feeds/<iso>.json`.
   If a [`../feeds/<id>/config.json`](../feeds/) declares
   `enhances: "<name>"` matching that Transitous source, apply its
   overrides (source swap, realtime URLs, license, metadata).
2. **HEAD `source.upstream_url`** — compare ETag against the previous
   `feeds.json`. Match → pass the previous entry through unchanged,
   skip everything below.
3. **`fetch-gtfs.ts`** — download the zip:
   - `source.type=transitous` → `api.transitous.org/gtfs/<iso>_<name>.gtfs.zip`
   - `source.type=remote`     → `source.upstream_url` from the override
4. **`validate.ts`** (`source.type=remote` only) — light Node spec-shape
   check (required files / columns, cross-references, monotonic
   `stop_sequence`). Transitous mirrors are trusted to upstream validation.
5. **`smoke-remote.ts`** (`source.type=remote` only) — per-feed contract
   check from the override's `smoke` block (expected
   `feed_publisher_name`, `trip_id` regex). Fails the build on
   contract violation.
6. **`derive-bbox.ts`** — `unzip -p` the zip's `stops.txt` /
   `agency.txt` / `feed_info.txt` → bbox, center, agencies, timezone,
   validity dates.
7. **`make-sqlite.ts`** — `.zip` → `<id>-<hash12>.sqlite3.gz`. Filename
   embeds the first 12 hex chars of the gzipped blob's sha256 so the
   R2 URL is **content-addressed**: a content change produces a new
   filename, and any cached copy at an old URL is by construction
   still correct for that URL. The raw `.gtfs.zip` is unlinked after;
   consumers fetch it from the upstream URL.
8. **`make-app-registry.ts`** — write Ajv-validated
   [`../outputs/feeds.json`](../outputs/feeds.json). Each entry's
   `files.sqlite_gz` is the hash-versioned basename produced above.

Output layout under `outputs/` (mirrors the R2 bucket root):

```
outputs/feeds.json
outputs/<id>-<hash12>.sqlite3.gz
```

## Skip-on-unchanged

Each `feeds.json` entry records `source.upstream_etag` at build time.
Next run, the orchestrator does a `HEAD` on `source.upstream_url`; if
the ETag matches AND the previous entry's `files.sqlite_gz` uses the
current hash-versioned shape, the whole feed is reused from the
previous registry — no download, no make-sqlite, no publish churn.
An entry with a legacy (non-hash-versioned) filename triggers a
one-time rebuild-to-migrate.

Previous registry is fetched from `${R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/feeds.json`
(default `https://gtfs.n3ary.com/feeds.json`) at the start of each
run, with `Cache-Control: max-age=300` on the upload side to bound
staleness.

Set `FORCE_REBUILD=true` (or trigger the daily workflow with `force:
true`) to bypass the skip and rebuild every feed — use after pipeline
code changes that affect output but don't touch the upstream feed.

## Helpers in `lib/`

- `csv.ts` — tiny GTFS-CSV parser (used by `derive-bbox.ts` /
  `validate.ts` / `smoke-remote.ts`)
- `http.ts` — shared `User-Agent` constant + `fetchJson` / `fetchText` /
  `fetchToFile`
- `mdb-rt.ts` — resolve realtime URLs via the MobilityData catalog
  (one-hop lookup from Transitous's `spec: gtfs-rt` siblings)
- `route-colors.ts` — per-type modal substitution + OKLCh hue rotation
  for colliding route_type modals + perceptual clustering for
  network colors
- `types.ts` — shared TS types for the static pipeline
