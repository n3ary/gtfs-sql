# install.sh can run two ways:
#   1. from inside a clone of the repo (REPO_ROOT exported) - the
#      config files are in $REPO_ROOT/apps/gtfs-rt/config
#   2. as a standalone bundle: this script + the systemd unit + the
#      healthcheck files + rt.env.example, all in the same directory,
#      dropped onto a fresh VM by the rebuild-gtfs-rt-vm workflow
#      via `curl .../config/{file}` (PR #149). The 3-level-up
#      heuristic that the original script used here resolves to the
#      filesystem root in that case, and the config-file preflight
#      checks fail. When REPO_ROOT is unset, fall back to the
#      script's own directory.
