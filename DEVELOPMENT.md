# Development Guide

## Contributing

`main` is protected — every change goes through a PR. See [docs/standards/version-management.md](docs/standards/version-management.md) for the bump-on-PR rule.

```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
# work, commit
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --fill
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

The PR-validation workflow ([`.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml)) runs on every PR, bumps `package.json#version` if needed, and runs the test/lint/pipeline smoke. Push to `main` (via the squash-merge) auto-triggers the daily pipeline via [`.github/workflows/daily.yml`](.github/workflows/daily.yml). Docs-only PRs (`docs/**`, `.github/`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `outputs/**`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig*.json`, `packages/*/src/schema/**`) are excluded from the bump and from the daily pipeline via `paths-ignore` so README edits don't churn the R2 bucket.

Branch protection:
- PR required, 0 approvals (solo-dev friendly)
- Linear history (squash/rebase only)
- No force-push, no branch deletion
- Admin override allowed for genuine emergencies

## Repository layout

This is a pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`). Three packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`apps/gtfs-static/`](apps/gtfs-static/) | The daily pipeline (CSV → sqlite3.gz → feeds.json → R2). Cron-triggered via GitHub Actions. |
| [`apps/gtfs-rt/`](apps/gtfs-rt/) | Placeholder for the live RT adapter (issue #34, step 7). Will run on Hetzner behind a CF edge cache. |
| [`packages/shared/`](packages/shared/) | Placeholder for `@ciotlosm/neary-gtfs-core` (issue #34, steps 3-5). Will hold GTFS spec types, CSV readers, SQLite DDL. |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 11+ (matched via `packageManager` field in `package.json`)
- `unzip` on PATH (every CI runner has it; macOS/Linux too)

No API keys needed — the pipeline only hits `api.transitous.org` and
whatever URLs are declared in per-feed `config.json` files.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build              # build all packages once before first run
```

## Commands

Root-level proxy commands (work from repo root):

```bash
pnpm run pipeline       # → pnpm --filter @gtfs/static pipeline
pnpm test               # → vitest --run across all packages
pnpm build              # → tsc across all packages
```

Inside `apps/gtfs-static/` you can also run the underlying tools directly:

```bash
cd apps/gtfs-static
pnpm pipeline           # full build → apps/gtfs-static/outputs/
pnpm test               # vitest
```

Pipeline anatomy lives at [`apps/gtfs-static/src/pipeline.README.md`](apps/gtfs-static/src/pipeline.README.md) — wait, actually at the package root: see the package's own README when added.

## Adding a feed

Single source of truth: [`apps/gtfs-static/countries.json`](apps/gtfs-static/countries.json) `include[]`.
Per-feed config files are optional overlays under `apps/gtfs-static/feeds/`.

### Default: plain Transitous mirror

1. Add the country's ISO code to `apps/gtfs-static/countries.json` `countries[]` if not already present.
2. Find the source name at
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/public-transport/transitous/main/feeds/<iso>.json`.
   Confirm `https://api.transitous.org/gtfs/<iso>_<name>.gtfs.zip`
   returns 200.
3. Add the name to `countries.json` `include[]`.
4. `pnpm pipeline` locally; confirm `apps/gtfs-static/outputs/feeds.json` validates
   and `apps/gtfs-static/outputs/<id>.sqlite3.gz` opens
   (`sqlite3 <(gunzip -c apps/gtfs-static/outputs/<id>.sqlite3.gz) 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips'`).

That's it — no `feeds/<id>/` needed for a plain mirror.

### Overlay app-side metadata or a different source

Create `apps/gtfs-static/feeds/<id>/config.json` when you need to:

- Swap the source for a sister-repo zip (`source.type=remote`)
- Provide / override realtime URLs (the MDB-resolver default may be
  missing or wrong)
- Override the inferred license text or attribution URL

Worked example: [`apps/gtfs-static/feeds/cluj-napoca/config.json`](apps/gtfs-static/feeds/cluj-napoca/config.json).

Minimum shape:

```json
{
  "enhances": "<TransitousName>",
  "license": { "attribution_text": "..." }
}
```

To use a sister-repo zip instead of Transitous, add:

```json
{
  "enhances": "<TransitousName>",
  "source": {
    "type": "remote",
    "publisher": "<who built the upstream zip>",
    "url": "https://.../the-feed.gtfs.zip"
  },
  "license": { "attribution_text": "..." },
  "smoke": {
    "expectedPublisher": "<must match feed_info.txt feed_publisher_name>",
    "tripIdPattern": "^...$"
  }
}
```

Other optional overlay fields: `id`, `name`, `country`, `region`,
`timezone`, `languages`, `realtime`. Anything you don't set
inherits from the Transitous-derived base.

Orphan overrides (a `feeds/<id>/` whose `enhances` doesn't match any
`include[]` entry) print a warning and produce nothing.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/daily.yml`](.github/workflows/daily.yml) runs at
00:30 UTC, on `workflow_dispatch`, and on every push to `main`,
uploading to the `neary-gtfs` Cloudflare R2 bucket. The app reads from
`https://gtfs.n3ary.com/feeds.json`.

### Publish target

Secrets and variables driving the R2 upload live in repo settings:

- Secrets: `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (R2 S3-compatible token,
  scoped Object Read+Write on the `neary-gtfs` bucket).
- Variables: `R2_S3_ENDPOINT`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.

Uploads set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` on both `feeds.json`
and each `<id>.sqlite3.gz` — matches the previous GitHub-raw behavior
so propagation stays bounded to ≤ 5 min per publish.

upstream sources, the consumer-side mirroring, the planned Hetzner RT
adapter) see [docs/architecture/infrastructure.md](docs/architecture/infrastructure.md).
